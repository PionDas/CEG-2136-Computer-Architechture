 CEG-2136-Computer-Architechture Labs
 
 Lab 2:
 The objective of this lab is to familiarize ourselves with sequential logic circuits. We will do this by designing a 3-bit synchronous modulo 6 counter with JK-flip flops and a 4-bit synchronous BCD counter. Both circuits will then be tested with 3 methods. The circuits will be tested with the use of LED lights with manual control, automatic control (slow), and automatic control (fast). The automatic control will be done using the Altera DE2-115 board. In the end, the final counter should be able to count between 0 to 59. 
 
 Lab 3:
 The objective of this lab is to design, build and test an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU will be able to perform any of the 16 micro operations that are seen in table 1. The control signals S3, S2, S1, and S0 will be used to switch between the micro operations. The inputs will be either A, B, 1 or 0. To determine the status, we have an ALU status register which has 4 status bits Cy, S, Z and V.  
 
 Lab 4:
 The Objective of this lab is to analyze the structure of a basic computer. The lab consists of 2 parts. The hardware portion consists of testing the construction of the control unit and the software part consists of writing and testing lower level languages. For the hardware part, we will determine the logic equations for the control unit. For the software part, we will use our assembly language writing skills developed to understand the code given and write our own assembly code.
